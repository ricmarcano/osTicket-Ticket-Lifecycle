<h2>The Process</h2>

To initiate ticket creation, users need to access the ticket portal and log in if required. Within this portal, users can submit ticket requests, outlining their IT-related problems. In this scenario there will be three example tickets created, each describing different issues that typically arise in a real-world environment. These tickets are formed using a Help Topic, a descriptive problem summary, and issue details, all composed similar to an email format.

From an administrative standpoint, once ticket requests are submitted, administrators will be able to access them from their panel once they have logged in. They have the capability to reassign tickets to suitable agents or teams. The issue's severity level is assessed and allocated to ensure that it's addressed within the specified SLA. In this instance, Jess observed a specific ticket, reassigned it to the "System Administrators" Department, elevated the Priority to "Emergency", and changed the SLA Plan to "SEV-A".

Effective communication is crucial when addressing ticket resolutions, involving interactions with both the team and impacted users. Tickets present a diverse range of issues, each aptly assigned to specific individuals. Comprehensive documentation is vital for a thriving environment, ensuring proper recording of tickets for potential future reference when encountering similar problems.

Ticket management protocols can vary based on the specific work environment, potentially involving quotas for resolving tickets within defined timeframes and prioritization of certain tickets based on circumstances. Once resolved, tickets appear under Tickets > Closed. It is considered good practice to look at closed tickets to get familiar with the types of issues a company regularly undergoes when first starting out on the job.
